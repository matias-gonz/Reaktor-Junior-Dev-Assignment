# Reaktor Junior Dev Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This was the first time I ever tried web development and I believe I did a good job considering I had to learn it from scratch.
I noticed there are still a few things to improve:

=> Loading times could be improved by using quicksort and binary search. This depends on the amount of times the user will need to switch categories.

=> Try to fetch data from server again if fails.
